# Tests

Everything in this directory is out-of-scope for vulnerabilities. These tests are the definition of what this
application is intended to do.

As you fix vulnerabilities, make sure these unit tests pass. Do not try to trick the tests - it is not guaranteed that
they use the same input in the test engine (although they are going to be pretty similar).
